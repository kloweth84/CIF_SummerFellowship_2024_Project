# Coding it Forward 2024 Summer Fellowship 

Repository contains the R code and slide deck that was created as part of the Coding it Forward 2024 Fellowship. Fellows worked with the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Annual Integrated Economic Survey (AIES) team to analyze the relationship between communication methods and respondent engagement for 7 annual economic surveys from survey years 2015-2022. Fellows used R to analyze the data and create visualizations that demonstrated patterns in engagement. This analysis helped the AIES team see how communication strategies have evolved over time and the difference in engagement between emails and postal mailings.

NOTE: All files here have gone through the U.S. Census Bureau's disclosure review process. As a result, all file paths have been changed. 

R code files:

1. **Feature Engineering**: creates new variables for the different communication-related datasets. 

2. **Exploratory Plots and Modeling**: includes exploratory visualizations of communication changes and respondent engagement over time. includes regression models at the survey level that predict the authentication code use rate (burn rate) by survey due date.

3. **Mail and Email Engagement Analysis**: looks at how respondent engagement changes after postal mailings and emails are sent.

4. **Due Date Analysis**: looks at respondent engagement in time windows near the survey due date through visualizations and modeling.
